# rpe-calcium-imaging
A fundamental bug was discovered in Matlab p-code that made it impractical to continue project pending further updates from Matlab.

A repository that contains code to streamline the acquisition of calcium imaging data for retinal pigment epithlium at the National Eye Instute. 

REQUIRES:
1. Matlab 2020a+
2. Data Acquisition Toolbox (4.1)
3. Data Acquisition Toolbox Support Package for National Instruments NI-DAQmx Devices (20.1.0)

The DAQ plotting and FIFO structures mimic the function as written in the "LiveDataAcquisition.mlapp." in Matlab 2020a. The front panel GUI was designed to mimic the basic structure of the Data Input Recorder Matlab 2020a app.
