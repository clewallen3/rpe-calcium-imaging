# rpe-calcium-imaging
A repository that contains code to streamline the acquisition of calcium imaging data for retinal pigment epithlium at the National Eye Instute. 

The DAQ plotting and FIFO structures mimic the function as written in the "LiveDataAcquisition.mlapp." in Matlab 2020a. The front panel GUI was designed to mimic the basic structure of the Data Input Recorder Matlab 2020a app.
